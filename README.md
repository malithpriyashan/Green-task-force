# Green-task-force
This website was created to facilitate garbage removal in Sri Lanka. Users can
join this website by registering. Once joined, users can add markers on the
map and provide descriptions of locations where there is garbage. The staff
then confirms or deletes the location after checking its validity. The captain
acts as the executive member who has the admin power and can perform
actions like adding or removing a staff member. The captain can also upgrade
a user to a member if he thinks so
